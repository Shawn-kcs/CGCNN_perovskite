Project Overview
This project features a modified implementation of the Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN) code. We focused on training the model with a custom dataset of perovskite structures and then used it to predict properties for a vast range of perovskite combinations.

Training Data ðŸ“š
We generated a custom training dataset consisting of 3,652 perovskite structures in CIF format. This data was produced through Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations.

Prediction on Perovskite Combinations ðŸ”®
Using the best-performing model from our training, we predicted the properties for an extensive dataset of 149,952 perovskite structures, which encompasses all possible element combinations.

Installation and Usage ðŸ”§
This project is based on the original Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CGCNN) implementation by Tian Xie.
